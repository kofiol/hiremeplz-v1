# HireMePlz Monorepo

## Job Search (End-to-End)

This repo includes a production-ready job search pipeline that:

- Builds QueryPlans from user profile/preferences
- Fetches LinkedIn jobs via Bright Data SDK
- Normalizes/dedupes jobs and computes explainable rankings
- Writes `job_sources`, `jobs`, and `job_rankings` atomically to Postgres/Supabase
- Tracks lifecycle in `agent_runs` (queued → running → succeeded/failed)

### Local setup

1) Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and fill values (never commit real keys).

2) Run Trigger.dev locally:

```bash
npx trigger.dev@latest dev
```

3) Trigger the workflow (manual):

- Task id: `job_search.run`
- Server endpoint: `POST /api/v1/job-search/trigger` ([route.ts](file:///c:/Users/psyhik1769/hiremeplz-monorepo/apps/web/src/app/api/v1/job-search/trigger/route.ts))

### Acceptance checklist

- `packages/job-source-router` exposes `RawJob` and `JobSourceRouter`
- Bright Data adapter uses `@brightdata/sdk` (no raw HTTP)
- `packages/query-plan-builder` produces 3–10 QueryPlans
- `packages/mapping-ranking` normalizes + scores with Zod-validated contracts
- `packages/workflows/job_search` runs the OpenAI Agent runner with typed tools and writes results idempotently
- `pnpm test` passes (unit + integration)

## Monorepo

This repo is based on the Turborepo starter.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build
yarn dlx turbo build
pnpm exec turbo build
```

You can build a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build --filter=docs

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build --filter=docs
yarn exec turbo build --filter=docs
pnpm exec turbo build --filter=docs
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev
yarn exec turbo dev
pnpm exec turbo dev
```

You can develop a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev --filter=web

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev --filter=web
yarn exec turbo dev --filter=web
pnpm exec turbo dev --filter=web
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo login

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo login
yarn exec turbo login
pnpm exec turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo link

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo link
yarn exec turbo link
pnpm exec turbo link
```
